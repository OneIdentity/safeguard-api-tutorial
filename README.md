One Identity Safeguard is built for integration with your existing systems.
It is built for automation to facilitate your initial deployment and your
on-going administration of the product. The key to automating and integrating
with Safeguard is to become comfortable using the Safeguard API and the
open source SDKs and scripting libraries created to support it.

## Safeguard for Privileged Passwords (SPP)

Safeguard for Privileged Passwords (SPP) is built with an API-first design.
This means that all product functionality is initially exposed as a public API
before it is added to any user interface. All SPP functionality (100%) is
available via the Safeguard API. There are even a few things that can ONLY be
done via the Safeguard API.

The following tutorials will help you to understand the SPP product design and
how to manipulate SPP via the Safeguard API. Each tutorial includes some
instruction and hands-on lab exercises to help you get familiar with new
technologies and techniques. Upon completing these tutorials, you will find
that using the Safeguard API and open source tools to deploy, automate, 
monitor, and support your Safeguard installation is easy and effective.
